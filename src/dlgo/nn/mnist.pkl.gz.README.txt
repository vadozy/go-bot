Images in the MNIST data set are squares with height and width of 28 pixels.
Load image data into feature vectors of size 784 = 28 Ã— 28; discard the image structure altogether and
look only at pixels represented as a vector. Each value of this vector represents a grayscale value
between 0 and 1, with 0 being white and 1 black.

The pickled data in mnist.pkl.gz: three sets of data: training, validation, and test data. Each set is a tuple (or list)
 of 2 elements: List of np.ndarray of shape (784,) and List of labels of type int.
